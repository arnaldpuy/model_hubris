# Mind the hubris in mathematical modeling

Arnald Puy and Andrea Saltelli

This is the R code and materials needed to reproduce the results and the figures of the book chapter, whose abstract is the following:

*Here we expose the philosophical foundations that ground the quest towards ever-detailed mathematical models in the natural sciences, and reflect on four practical issues derived from this pursuit: explosion of the model's uncertainty space, model black-boxing, computational exhaustion and model attachment. We argue that the addition of model detail as a mean to produce more accurate estimates brings about important paradoxes and trade-offs that should be considered lest models become extraneous constructs chasing the Cartesian dream.*

## Information

We provide the code in `.R`, `.rmd`and `.pdf`. We also provide the following datasets:

* `lines_code.csv` (Méndez et al. 2014).
* `cyclomatic_complexity.csv` (Méndez et al. 2014).
* `transistors-per-microprocessor.csv`
* `supercomputer-power-flops.csv`
* `watts.txt`
* `cores.txt`
* `frequency.txt`
* `specint.txt`
* `transistors.txt`
* `dark_silicon_percentage.csv`
